# FlashLog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### About:
FlashLog is a simple, yet poorly coded program written in C#, that reads log files in real time. If the log file gets updated, the program will also update dynamically.
It supports drag and drop too.

After selecting a file, it saves its path, so the next time you open FlashLog it will re-open the file.

The program also has decent error handling, such as if the file is not found, file is in use, etc. Along with that,
it also does it in real time.

### Additional Information:
* FlashLog was compiled with Visual Studio 2019
* Please feel free to fork and make this program better. It needs a lot of work and it's not perfect, at all
