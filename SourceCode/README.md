# FlashLog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### About:
FlashLog is a program that reads log files in real time. If the log file gets updated, the program will also update dynamically.
It supports drag and drop too.

After selecting a file, it saves its path, so the next time you open FlashLog it will re-open the file.

The program also has decent error handling, such as if the file is not found, file is in use, etc. Apart from that,
it also does it in real time.
